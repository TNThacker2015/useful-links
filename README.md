# Useful Links
## This repository contains many, MANY useful links for many different things.
### If you feel like something needs to be added to this at all, please feel free to open a Pull Request or Issue and I will read it over and we can discuss if it should really be added or not.
### There will be a .md file for each topic, and inside each file will be a table showing the name of what the specific link is, the origin page's name, and the link itself. This can also be changed down the road, follow the same instructions as above and we can discuss it.

Thanks for using my Useful Links repository!
